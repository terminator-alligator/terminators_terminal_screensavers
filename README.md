# Terminators Terminal Screensavers (ttss)
## About

This project provides a collection of terminal-based screensavers written in Go, using the excellent [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and [Lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss) libraries.

It is inspired by how terminal text effects [ChrisBuilds/terminaltexteffects](https://github.com/ChrisBuilds/terminaltexteffects) is used on Omarchy Linux, except designed more around being used as a screensaver rather than an animation library.

**Important Note:** This is a personal project, and I do not have extensive experience with Go, Git, or GitHub. Some of my Go code may be unconventional. Feel free to offer advice on how I could run things more efficiently or improve overall.
