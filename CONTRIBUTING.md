Thank you for your interest in contributing! We welcome and appreciate all contributions.

This is a passion project, and to maintain its quality and direction, all contributions will be reviewed. Please don't be discouraged if changes are requested or if a contribution doesn't quite fit the project's vision.

If my code looks a bit weird in some areas, it's probably for one of three reasons I thought it was a good idea I didn't know any better or I had too much tea and coffee and that was the best my brain could come up with.

## Proposing a Change
To avoid spending time on a feature that might not be accepted, **please open an issue first** to discuss your idea. This allows us to align on the proposal before you start writing code.

## Use of Generative AI

Using generative AI to assist in development is permitted, but please adhere to the following guidelines:

*   **You Own Your Code:** You are responsible for any code you submit. You must be able to read, understand, and explain it, regardless of its origin.
*   **Follow Project Style:** Ensure any AI-generated code is refactored and formatted to match the project's existing style and conventions.
*   **Use AI as a Tool:** AI should be used as an assistant to help you solve problems or generate boilerplate, not to write entire features for you. Submitting large, unmodified blocks of AI-generated code is disallowed.

## Docs

Improvements to the documentation are always welcome! If you spot a typo or feel something could be explained better, please feel free to open a pull request.

## Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug, please open an issue and provide as much detail as possible. Include the following:

*   A clear description of the bug.
*   Steps to reproduce the behavior.
*   Your operating system (e.g., Windows 11, Ubuntu 22.04).
*   The terminal you are using (e.g., Alacritty, Windows Terminal).
*   Screenshots or GIFs, if applicable.
